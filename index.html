    <h2>What are the Parts of a Plant?</h2>
    <p>
     Like most living creatures, plants need a way to reproduce. Some plants only have an ovule, and other plants just have a stamen, and in some cases 
     plants have both reproductive parts. The stamen has the pollen which when spread to an ovule can help a plant reproduce. In order to attract pollinators
     plants produce nectar in the nectaries, which can be located in an any part of the plant. Plants also have roots, which have the responsibility of 
     giving the plant nutrients and water. Plants often have pentals which also contribute to attracting pollinators.
